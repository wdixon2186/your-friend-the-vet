            Around four years ago I was standing in the living room of a house, with a dry erase marker in my hand, and I was intensely explaining to the ever so hot Sean Coulahan my theory on Jon Snow becoming Azor Ahai. (And how he would single handedly wipe out the white walkers. My thought was he would die, and they’d try to burn his body, and his body wouldn’t burn showing he’s a Targaryen, but the smoke would be there! And the salt from the tears! And the red… You get the point.) 

            This was pretty close to my peak of Game of Thrones fandom, and I honestly can say I don’t know if I’ve ever been as invested in a story as this one. There are obviously a few great epics out there, that constantly pit good and evil against each other. They feed us with interesting and loveable characters, and add a dash of characters we despise. If you asked me to name a few I’d give you some of the largest franchises we’ve experienced. Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Marvel Cinematic Universe, Dark Knight Trilogy, Avatar the last airbender etc. I have love for all of these epics, all of these worlds, but Game Of thrones was different. 
            
            You see, to me, Game of Thrones was a new kind of storytelling. One that I’ve never really experienced in the scale it was working in. The story would build a world of what you thought was good and evil, and then flip it on its head. People you rooted for were doing some things you might not agree with. People you despised were revealing some sympathetic traits. Every character in this show is so layered, so human, so developed that many times when things happened, I’d think to myself, “Wow, they were so cruel back then.” Only to be brought back to earth when I’d see a dragon, or a magical priestess, and remember that I’m watching a fantasy show. 
            
            This show also stood out with its lack of conventions. It became very hard to find a character that you knew would make it to the finale. SPOILERS. When I started watching I thought it’d be about Ned Stark having to go to war with his best friend. When Ned was executed, I realized the story was about his kids, and how they will avenge their father. Then Rob Stark and his mother were executed, which… WHAT! And the show still worked, I still wanted more, it became so unpredictable, and so intriguing that I became obsessed with it. 
            
            You know the kind of obsessed that is toxic in some ways. Like when people would bring up the show, I’d subtly think they weren’t as true of a fan as me. Or when they started watching later than I did, I knew they hadn’t gone through the agonizing week by week, year by year schedule for as long as I have, and therefor are not true fans! But my weird ego aside, this show had me staying up late, researching every hint, character, or past story I could find, to the point where I could probably name the history of Westeros better than the history of the actual world. And I went to school where real history was mandatory.
